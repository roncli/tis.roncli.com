<b>UPDATE 4/7/2025</b><br />
It's the best update that no one ever asked for... Dark Mode!  I also made several improvements to the code base for better maintainability.<br /><br />

<b>UPDATE 5/2/2021</b><br />
I've monitored the bandwidth the site uses and have increased the downloads to 1000 per 12 hours.<br /><br />

<b>UPDATE 5/5/2018</b><br />
We're back!  However, we will now be limiting downloads to 50 per 12 hours since I'm no longer running this site off of an unmetered connection.  If you need more than this, please contact <a href="mailto:roncli@roncli.com">roncli@roncli.com</a> with details.<br />
Also, I've upgraded the code from classic ASP to node.js.  The code behind this site now has a public repository, and you can find that at <a href="https://github.com/roncli/tis.roncli.com">https://github.com/roncli/tis.roncli.com</a>.<br /><br />

<b>UPDATE 10/31/2012</b><br />
The directory OSMusic has the music from my old site OSMusic.Net<br /><br />

<b>UPDATE 8/6/2006</b><br />
The directory FokusTrackz has the music from the Fokus project, for those who remember it. There's some good tracks in there.<br /><br />

<b>UPDATE 9/3/2004</b><br />
Thanks to Zola for getting me copies of song IDs 3654, 3655, and 3656, ones that were damaged on the CDs I have. They are online!<br /><br />

<b>Why are there SongIDs missing?</b><br />
There are two possible reasons for this. First, the song could have been removed from Trax in Space, either by the artist's intentions or by the file being corrupt. In either case, the song was simply deleted. Second, there were big gaps in the 14000 series caused by problems with the automatic uploader, which caused many SongIDs to go unused.<br /><br />

<b>What do these files that have lost.txt mean?</b><br />
There are 2 known songs that I could not upload to the server, due to CRC errors from the original CD. These are SongIDs 15008 and 15009. The files are still in place, but instead contain a .txt file indicating that the file has been lost, possibly forever.<br /><br />

<b>Can I contribute to this archive?</b><br />
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline line-through;">YES!!!</span> But I will only take seriously large contributions that span hundreds or thousands of files. Please contact me at <a href="mailto:roncli@roncli.com">roncli@roncli.com</a> with details, and I'll give you information on how to send them to me.
